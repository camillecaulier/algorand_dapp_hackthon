TODO
Read networks part of Reach   https://docs.reach.sh/networks/
Read rock-paper-scissors tutorial ? https://docs.reach.sh/tut/rps/
Check how NFTs are implemented in Reach (is launchToken sufficient? check NFT example)
make smart contract structure (sarting with JS command line interface on DevNet)
Understand what opting in and out means
Check out algosdk documentation (available functions)

Do we really have to use algosdk or is the fact that we use the Algorand connector enough?

explains basics, how to set connector, command line interface with args, units, cancelling a transaction, views (before attaching)

very useful functions for frontend (will be used for sure, especially the first half)

NOTES
REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE env variable to be set
use walletconnect (if browser-based dapp) -> lets user choose wallet
(do we need wallets for non browser-based dapps?)
